I really hate Euporia at first, I can't even finish the first episode. After I see a video about what kind of editing and sytle it got from preview films, I decide to see through it again.

Because this story is totally toxic, I can't allow this happen, when poor kids don't have the oppotunity to persuade their dreams, these rich American kids do what they can to ruin their life with no gratitude, and they will annonce that it's a worthful journey to discover themselves, that is bullshit. I know maybe I seem to have a narrowed perspective on this topic, but it's what I thought the whole time.

Truelly enough, the outstanding photography and great storytelling makes this an epic drama.I like Zendaya in this.
