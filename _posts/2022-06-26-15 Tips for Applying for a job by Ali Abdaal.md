- **The third door**

  There is always a third door like night club, you can go down the alley way, pop up the kitchen window and sneak in the back to make friends with the staffs, you can get in the night club through the third door.

- **Slide into People's DMs**

  A third-door application technique. Call the emails and DMs you want to work for, they may not reply, but you can send another one, maybe at right time, the right person will see the email and give you a shot.

- **Be an Opportunist**

  A lot of CEOs have instagram account and you can find, trying to find the platform they are active on.

- **Make It Easy for Them To Say Yes**

  It's an experiment, let's just try it for a month, if you don't like, you don't have to pay me, it's a learning opportunity for both of us. Making it seem a no brain think for your employer. Building your portfolio, going after for people, basically working for them for free for month or several weeks so that is super easy for them to say yes.

  Hiring is very hard for companies, anything makes it easy for them will give you an access to the door.

  If you do have tons of experience, there absolutely no harm tailoring your CV to the specific job you apply for. Figuring out what the job you genuiely want, figuring out ways you adjust your CV so it fix to one page or maybe two.

- **Lead With Value (Cover Letter)**

  ‚ùåÔºöSelfish reasons (gain experience......). Employers don't care about why the job will benefit you.

  ‚≠ïÔ∏èÔºöWhy employers should hire you.

  Cover letter don't have to be paragraphs like Personal Statement(PS), no rules, it's just numbers of bullet points why the company should hire you.

- **Go Above and Beyond In Your Application**

  Reach out to your dream company's hiring manager, apply and go above and beyond in your application. Putting extra effort beyond you apply for.

- **Understand the Vibe**

  Finding the vibe of people who want to hire you and pass the vibe check. If the company are more equal and friendly, you don't need to write formally to apply the job, it's like cooperate world and startup company. 

- **Please Don't Bullshit**

  The employers prefer here is the things I am good at and here is the evidence why I am good at them. You need examples to illustrate conceptual words. Try to substantiate with details why you make such a claim.

- **Write for Clarity Rather Than Impression**

  We are taught to use big words to sound intelligent in school, but when applying for a job, no one wants to read big words. Never use a big word if short word is suffice. "Use" rather than "utilize".

- **Dial in Your Level of Enthusiasm**

  In a way, you don't want to be hiring someone who is too much a fan boy or a fan girl. You can say that but don't sound like an ultimate fan.

- **Be Paranoid**

  Take the time to look over your application and make sure there doesn't have the basic errors in it.

- **Consider a Video Application**

  Record a quick video. It's very chill and this person is a real person and showing their pesonality, seems to be enthusiastic. Email with a video and the hiring manager will admire you for taking the time and effort, you become an actual person, not just candidate x.

- **Do the Things Well**

  Whatever you are doing, just do the things very well. Even if you leave the company, the latter employer may ask the former employer for reference. Through performing very well on your job, you will connect the A player in your area, they may want to hire you.
