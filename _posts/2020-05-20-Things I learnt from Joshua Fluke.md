description: 一些我从Joshua Fluke吸取的职业建议

---



Everytime I watch a worthy Joshua Fluke video, I will write down what I think is important to keep in mind while looking for the job or working for the company. After I quitted my first job in a bank, I realised it is very important to keep a clear mind on the things which have a long impact on the future rather than just what matters now. It's very easy to forget your personal goal when you are at your job. So I have decided to record the following:

- Since you graduate from college, everything is <font color=blue > a race against time </font>.
- If you wanna retire with the company, you better have a one-on-one with the CEO type of the deal.
- <font color=blue>There is no job security</font>, just apply a job when you are on a job, then you can have emails to go up to.
- <font color=blue>Always look up for yourself</font>, you can't consider that paycheck consistent.
- I mean every minute the boss man isn't looking at you and you've successfully completed all your work for the day, you should be considering if I didn't have this job what would I do.
- You should have boundaries into the job.
