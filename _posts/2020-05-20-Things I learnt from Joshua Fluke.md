Everytime I watch a worthy Joshua Fluke video, I will write down what I think is important to keep in mind while looking for the job or working for the company. After I quitted my first job in a bank, I realised it is very important to keep a clear mind on the things which have a long impact on the future rather than just what matters now. It's very easy to forget your personal goal when you are at your job. So I have decided to record the following:

- Since you graduate from college, everything is  **a race against time** .

- If you wanna retire with the company, you better have a one-on-one with the CEO type of the deal.

- **There is no job security**, just apply a job when you are on a job, then you can have emails to go up to.

- **Always look up for yourself**,  you can't consider that paycheck consistent.

- I mean every minute the boss man isn't looking at you and you've successfully completed all your work for the day, you should be considering if I didn't have this job what would I do.

- You should have boundaries into the job.

- "All information including financial and decision-making is shared to all employees."

  - This is key. At a regular job, you have no insight to finances and that sort of decision-making with the CEO. So if they're willing to share those numbers with you, that's great.And at a start-up especially they should share those numbers with you.

    The more financial transparency that the upper people have with you, the more you can trust them.They are not trying to hide anything , they're not trying to make any sneaky moves. Everything is very clear and upfront.

    Honestly, if I could see like a track record of the person that is leading or in charge of making these financial decisions and they are good then I'm going to be more likely to believe that I can work here for a long amount of time and benefit myself just as much as I'm benefiting them.
